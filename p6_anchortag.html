       <strong>What is a Static Website?</strong><br>
       A static website is made up of webpages created using HTML, CSS and Javascript (all examples of web development languages). Each page on a static website is stored as a single HTML file , which is delivered directly from the server to the webpage exactly as is. This content essentially becomes a part of the design on your page, and won’t change unless the original HTML file is edited at a code level. <br>
       Changes to a static website can be done manually, and will only be made page by page, HTML file by HTML file. For example, edits made to the HTML file of a homepage will only be reflected on the homepage. This is true even for elements that are identical across the whole site, such as the footer. If you’re using a website builder, changes to static pages will be made automatically every time you use the website editor. <br>
       One of the most characteristic aspects of a static site is that every user receives and views the exact same content. Because of this, static websites work best for sites with fewer pages that don’t require frequent updates or changes. <br>
       A good candidate for a static site is a resume website. This is a type of site with set content for each page, and doesn't require many changes to individual pages, or real-time updates based on user behavior. Other examples of common static website types include personal websites, nonprofit websites and purely informative websites (good examples of these include one page or landing page sites).  

       <h1 id="dynamic">Dynamic Web Page</h1>
       <p>
        <strong>What is Dynamic Website?</strong> <br>
        Built using server side language and technology, dynamic websites allow for the content of each page to be delivered and displayed dynamically, or on-the-fly, according to user behavior or from user-generated content. <br>


        With a dynamic website all of your data and content are organized in a database or backend Content         Management System (CMS), which connects to your website pages. The way this information is arranged and         connected to your site’s design controls how and when its content is revealed on a page. <br> 


        What does all of this mean? Well, dynamic content gives you the ability to customize and personalize the         website experience, and what is displayed, for a specific user. It also allows you to make changes to         many pages at the same time, since modifications made to one dynamic page can be automatically made across thousands. <br>
        For example, dynamic websites enable you to choose which information is displayed to auser based on         their location. You can also deliver content to users based ontheir current or past actions on your         site (thanks Cookies), which essentiallymeans each visitor sees a different view of the content on a         page. Amultilingual website is a great example of when creating a dynamic website might berelevant.
